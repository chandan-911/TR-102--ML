# TR-102--ML

## Introduction
Welcome to the TR-102--ML repository! This project contains various implementations of machine learning algorithms and models. The objective is to explore and understand different machine learning techniques and apply them to real-world datasets to solve a variety of problems.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains datasets used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved models and checkpoints.
- `results/`: Evaluation metrics, plots, and other results.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and overview.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
