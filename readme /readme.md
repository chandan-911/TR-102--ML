# Machine Learning Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning algorithms and models. The goal of this project is to explore different machine learning techniques, understand their implementation, and apply them to real-world datasets to solve various problems.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains datasets used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved models and checkpoints.
- `results/`: Evaluation metrics, plots, and other results.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and overview.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/chandan-911/TR-102--ML.git
   cd TR-102--ML
